# BlueOceanIOT Core for SAM3X CPUs

This repository contains the source code and configuration files of the BlueOceanIOT Boards based on Arduino Core for Atmel's SAM3X processor (used on the [Arduino Due](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDue) board).

## Installation on Arduino IDE

This core is available as a third party package in the Arduino IDE cores manager.

From  Arduino's preferences add the following path to Additional Board Manager URLs:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhagstrand/blueoceaniot-m3-144/main/blueocean_m3_144/packages_blueoceaniot_index.json

 You may need to restart Arduino for this, but then you can open the "Boards Manager" and install the package called:

 * **BlueOceanIOT SAM Boards (32-bit ARM Cortex-M3)**
